For years I have sought to fix the ugly color sceme in vscode.
I want BLUE functions and YELLOW variables.
Well, no longer will I have to wait!
I have discovered how to reassign the colors,
and all it took were some lambdas and decorators!

# it's yellow, but it's now a constant!

# how to make the letters blue in vs code:
double = lambda x: 2*x

On a serious note, this section was horrifying.
That was like some of the worst code I've ever written.
I feel dirty after coding that. Eww.
